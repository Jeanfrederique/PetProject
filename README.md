Sending data through a form and back

This is just a small project i've been working on where a user enters data into a form, save data to mysql and displays back the entries to the Front End. Also, user should be able to delete entries, but that's not working.  Maybe anyone could look at the mysql syntax i've used and let me know what I can do better.
